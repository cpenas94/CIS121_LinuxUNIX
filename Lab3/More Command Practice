1. sed
a) Change the word “home” into the word “apartment” in the /etc/password file, putting the
result in a file in your home directory.
• sed ‘s/home/apartment/g’ /etc/passwd > ~/housing.file
b) Delete lines 10 through 20 from the /etc/passwd file (just to your screen – don’t try to save it.)
• sed ’10,20d’ /etc/passwd
c) Delete all the lines in /etc/passwd that use the “bash” shell. (This should produce exactly the
same results as in the grep example 1c in lab5.)
• sed ‘/\/bash/d’ /etc/passwd
d) Change “/bin/bash” to “/usr/bin/bash” in /etc/passwd (don’t save it.) Note that you’ll need to
use a different character than “/” in the “s” command for sed.
• sed ‘s?/bin/bash?/usr/bin/bash?g /etc/passwd
e) Change the ‘:” field separator to a single space, in /etc/password (don’t forget ‘g’).
• sed ‘s/:/ /g’ /etc/passwd
f) Try to insert two TAB characters as field separators in /etc/password. In order to get the TAB
characters into the command line, you’ll have to preceed each one with a “^V” (Ctrl-V) (because of the
bash shell.)
• sed ‘s/:/\t\t/g’ /etc/passwd
2. sort
a) Use cut to get the fifth field of /etc/password (the full name), and sort that field on the second
name.
• cut -d: -f5 /etc/passwd | sort -k2
b) Sort the output of “ls -l” by size (note you need -n and –k.)
• ls -l | sort -nk5
c) Same as b), but in reverse order (largest file first).
• ls -l | sort -nrk5
3. uniq – and other commands
a) (This is a repeat from a previous lab.) Use uniq with the “-c” flag to find how many accounts
are using each shell on newton (or your own computer).
• cut -d: -f7 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -c
b) The sixth field in /etc/password is the home directory of each account; cut out that field, but
just for the student accounts (they all have “students” in the home directory name; use "grep" after
the cut), and then cut again to get the fourth element of it (the one after /students/), then sort on
that fourth element, and use uniq to find out how many of each directory there are. Note you have to
use “cut" twice, with two different delimiters (“:” and “/”), and then sort and uniq –c. Also note that
in counting fields in the path name of the home directory, the first field is null, before the first “/”.
• grep students /etc/passwd | cut -f6 -d: | cut -f4 -d/ | sort | uniq -c
4. Again, using the same script you wrote in Lab 4 and changed in Lab 5: change the line you just
added in Lab 5 to read:
#! /bin/bash
#
# Henry Penas | 09/19/2023
# Commands Used:
#
filename=$1
# Real Name:
echo Henry Penas > $filename
#
# Account Name:#
who am I >> $filename
#
# When account file was last modified:
ls -l .profile >> $filename
#
# How long the "/etc/passwd" file is:
wc /etc/passwd >> $filename
#
#Permissions of 'friends':
ls -l friends >> Lab4InfoFile
