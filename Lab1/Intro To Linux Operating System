  • **Filled with the following words:
  • This
  • Is

4. Browse the file. Look at the beginning of the file; look at the end.
  • cat text1
5. Copy the file "text1" to a new file.
  • cp text1 text2
6. Change the name of the old file.
  • mv text1 TEXT1.1
7. How do you know it's there (what commands could you use to find out?)
  • ls
8. What command(s) will show its permissions?
  • ls -l TEXT1.1
9. What command(s) will show how big it is?
  • ls -l TEXT1.1
10. What command(s) will show how many lines are in it?
