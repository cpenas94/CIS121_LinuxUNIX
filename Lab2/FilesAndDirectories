Lab 3: Files and Directories
1. Make sure you are in your home directory.
cd
2. Make a directory "class".
mkdir class
3. Confirm this directory exists now.
ls -d class
4. Copy the file "friends" (that you just created or found) to a new file in the "class"
subdirectory.
cp friends class/
5. Go to that subdirectory (class).
Cd class
6. Confirm that the file exists.
ls friends
7. Rename that file to "friends2".
mv friends friends2
8. While still in "class", copy who_report from your home directory to class.
cp ~/who_report .
9. Go back to your home directory.
cd
10. Move several files from here to the subdirectory class.
mv king kong kang class/
11. Move all the files in class back to the parent directory.
mv class/*
12. Create a new file in your directory (your choice of names), containing: - your real name -
your account name - when your ".bash_profile" file was last modified - how long the file
"/etc/passwd" file is - the permissions of the "friends" file (Can you do this without actually
typing all the information, by just redirecting the output of various commands?)
finger > lab3
who am I >> lab3
ls -l .profile >> lab3
wc /etc/passwd >> lab3
ls -l friends >> lab3
13. Print the file you just created, with page number and date. (Since you can't actually print
from newton right now, just save the output.)
pr lab3
14. Make a copy of the file you created, but call the copy "foobar".
cp lab3 foobar
15. Make a new file and put all the commands you ran in #12 in it. That is, in the file put the
commands that would create another new file (different name from what you used in #12)
with the same information in it.
finger > lab3.1
who am I >> lab3.1
ls -l .profile >> lab3.1
wc /etc/passwd >> lab3.1
ls -l friends >> lab3.1
16. Change the permissions of the new file you just made (in #15) so anyone can write it, and
anyone in your group (but no one else) can execute it. Notice that means you can't execute it.
Also make sure it is readable by everybody.
Chmod 676 lab3.1
17. Now try to execute the new file, by typing "./" in front of the file name. It should fail (if
you set the permissions as instructed). So try by typing:
bash <filename> (where "filename" is the name you gave it)
bash lab3.1
Put the name of the file you created as part of the commands in number 19, that you turn in.
18. Look at the first few lines of your files, using wild cards ('*', '?'). (Don't forget a pager, if
you have a lot of output.) Then save those lines in a new file, and try to print it. (Notice
whether the first lines of the new file you just created are in the listing.) Make sure you only
print 2 or 3 lines from each file! (You may have to send the file to your local computer to
print, it can't be printed directly from the server.)
